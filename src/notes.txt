As we dont have a settings config defined for development and production
enviroments, we should modify all the ports for production.

Current list of ports per device (development / production):
- Broker:       "ws://localhost:8888"     -   "ws://52.149.210.210:8080"
- Button:       "http://localhost:3000"   -   "http://13.92.46.254:8080"

- SmartPhone:   "http://localhost:3002"   -   "http://20.102.77.147:8080"
